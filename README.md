# Pirate Invasion
### A pirate invasion minigame plugin developed for Minecraft 1.8

### Features:
* PvP on separate pirate ships
* Middle island containing gold
* Round system

Pirate Invasion is my first minigame plugin which was made in 2015. There are a lot of optimizations which have been left undone since that time. The code is open for interpretation and is meant to serve as a benchmark for anyone interested in coding.
